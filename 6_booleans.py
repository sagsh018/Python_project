# Operators that allows you to convey True or False statements
# uses in if and else logic

print(True)
# True
print(False)
# False
# print(true)
# NameError: name 'true' is not defined. So this is basically not able to recognize true with small t and thinks that
# its a variable and hence complaining that it it not defined.
# So make sure every time you uses True and False with capital T and F.
print(type(True))
# <class 'bool'>

# These are used to test the conditions and operators like
print(1 > 2)
# False
print(1 == 1)
# True

# None return type ================= This is used as a place holder, when suppose you want to define some variable
# but don't  want to assign nay value to it
b = None
print(b)
# None
# now since we have not defined b with some value, then also python didn't complained about it.
